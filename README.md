Unlocking Customer Preferences: Analyzing Zomato Data for Strategic Insights

### **Zomato Data Analysis Project** üçΩÔ∏è

In my Zomato Data Analysis Project, I applied data science techniques to explore customer behaviors and restaurant performance metrics using a rich dataset from Zomato. The project aimed to uncover actionable insights that could guide Zomato in enhancing its services and targeting customer segments more effectively.

**1. Data Preparation and Cleaning** üßπ
- **Objective:** Address inconsistencies and prepare data for meaningful analysis.
- **Action:** The `rate` column presented a challenge due to its complex format. I cleaned this column by removing the denominator ("out of 5") and converted it into a numeric data type. This transformation enabled accurate quantitative analysis of ratings.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas

**2. Customer Preference Analysis** üéØ
- **Objective:** Determine which types of restaurants customers prefer for placing orders.
- **Action:** I used countplots to visualize and identify the most popular restaurant categories among Zomato customers. This analysis helped in understanding customer preferences across different restaurant types.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Seaborn, Matplotlib

**3. Customer Engagement and Loyalty Analysis** üåü
- **Objective:** Measure customer engagement through the votes received by each restaurant type.
- **Action:** By plotting a line graph of the votes across different restaurant types, I identified which restaurants had higher customer loyalty and which ones needed improvement. This analysis was crucial in understanding how well certain types of restaurants are received by customers.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Seaborn, Matplotlib

**4. Ratings Distribution Analysis** üìä
- **Objective:** Discover the ratings distribution across the platform to gauge overall customer satisfaction.
- **Action:** I utilized a histogram to examine the distribution of ratings that restaurants received, identifying the most common ratings and thereby assessing general customer satisfaction levels.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Seaborn, Matplotlib

**5. Offline Orders Insight** üõçÔ∏è
- **Objective:** Identify which restaurant types excel in offline orders to enhance Zomato's offline services.
- **Action:** A boxplot was used to analyze the distribution of offline orders across different restaurant types. This analysis revealed which restaurants received more offline orders, helping Zomato tailor offers and promotions effectively.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Seaborn, Matplotlib

**6. Final Recommendations** üìà
- **Outcome:** Based on the insights derived from the above analyses, I provided Zomato with recommendations to improve customer engagement, optimize ratings, and target offline customers more effectively. My analysis demonstrated a clear understanding of customer behavior and offered data-driven strategies to enhance Zomato's competitive edge.

**Overall Tech Stack**:
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, Numpy
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Programming Language:** Python

This project showcases my ability to transform complex data into meaningful insights, utilizing a robust tech stack and data science methodologies. The detailed exploration and actionable insights provided a strong foundation for strategic decision-making, demonstrating my proficiency in data analysis and visualization.
